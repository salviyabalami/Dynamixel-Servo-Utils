# Dynamixel Servo Utilities

A collection of Python scripts for working with **Dynamixel servos** (tested on XL330 series with U2D2, Protocol 2.0).  
Includes utilities for scanning connected servos, changing IDs, recovering misconfigured servos, health checks, ping/read diagnostics, and monitoring.

---

## üìÇ Included Scripts

- **`scan_servos.py`**  
  Scans a given serial port and lists all detected servos, reporting ID, position, voltage, temperature, and status.

- **`change_id.py`**  
  Safely changes the ID of a single connected servo.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è *Important: Only power one servo at a time when running this script to avoid conflicts.*

- **`recover.py`**  
  Attempts to find and recover a misconfigured servo by scanning across common baud rates.

- **`health_check.py`**  
  Performs a quick diagnostic on each detected servo (temperature, voltage, error flags, etc.) to verify that it is operating within safe ranges.

- **`ping_and_read.py`**  
  Pings a servo by ID and reads basic control table values such as present position, velocity, and torque state. Useful for verifying communication with individual servos.

- **`discover_and_read.py`**  
  Scans all IDs at the selected baud and prints live Present Position values for each detected servo. Useful for monitoring many servos simultaneously.
